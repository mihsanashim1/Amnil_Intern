// JavaScript 
/*
    Invented by Brenden Eich in 1995


    - at the beginning age of Browser,Netscape and Internet explorer were popular browsers. They had different scripting language for their browsers
    - windows came with JScript whereas Netscape cam with MediaSourceHandle. The problem was the website made using JScript was unable to run on Netscape. 
    Similarly the website made using Mocha was unable to run on InternetExplorer.

    - To solve this issue , ECMA international came with the standard called ECMA Script, which standardized Script that runs on the Web.

    - Js was initially named mocha and then Livescript. later it was named Javascript and launched in 1995.

    - It is an interpreted language.



    - Web Browsers(JS engine) are responsible for interpretation of JS code.
    eg. V8 engine(chrome), spidermonkey(FireFox).. and so on.


    - Previously, js was confined to web browsers only.
    - From the release of Nodejs(2009). JS is no more confined to web browsers. Then, only the revolution of JS for backend took place.

    - to run js outside the web browsers we use node command (node abc.js)
