// CSS

/*
    - CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) was first proposed in 1994, by Norwegian technologist Håkon Wium Lie, who was then working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) with Berners-Lee. 
    Two years later the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) adopted the first standardized specifications for CSS, called CSS1. 
    Microsoft’s Internet Explorer became the first commercial browser to support CSS. In 1998 CSS2 was released, offering improved layout control and the ability to specify how content would appear on different platforms, including handheld devices, print, screen, television, and even Braille. CSS3, rolled out in 2011, added additional functionalities, such as responsive Web design and support for many new font types. It also introduced modules.
